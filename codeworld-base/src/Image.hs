-- | @image(name, url, w, h)@ is an image from a standard image format.

-- * @name@ is a name for the picture, used for debugging.
-- * @url@ is a data-scheme URI for the image data.
-- * @w@ is the width in CodeWorld screen units.
-- * @h@ is the height in CodeWorld screen units.
--
-- The image can be any universally supported format, including SVG, PNG,
-- JPG, etc.  SVG should be preferred, as it behaves better with
-- transformations.
