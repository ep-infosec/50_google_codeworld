program.hs:16:23-27: error:
    • The & operator cannot be used with functions.
    • If you intended to combine animations,
      you must combine the frames in a function, instead.
    • For example:
          program = animationOf(a & b)
      should be written instead as:
          program = animationOf(overall)
          overall(t) = a(t) & b(t)
